# Prediction Project

This project demonstrates the use of Python to build and evaluate a predictive model. The notebook walks through the key steps of data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature engineering techniques
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using key metrics

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and others used in the notebook.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `Prediction-Opportunites.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## Output

The notebook outputs predictions and evaluates the model's performance using visualizations and statistical metrics.
